## 🌟 About the Project

DesiNest is my **first full-stack web application**, inspired by Airbnb. This project is more than just code — it’s a reflection of growth, resilience, and passion.  
Every bug, every error, every late night — led to this proud moment of deploying something real and working.

This project allows users to create and manage property listings, view them on maps, authenticate securely, and enjoy a smooth UI with interactive animations.
